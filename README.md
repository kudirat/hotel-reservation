# hotel-reservation

# Description
In this project, I designed and implemented a Java hotel reservation application. The hotel reservation application allows customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability.
This project demonstrates my abilities to design classes using OOP, organize and process data with collections, and use common Java types.
